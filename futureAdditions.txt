=======================================================
Ideas for new features:
  - [Idea] (Difficulty to implement)
  - Finishing the game. (Medium)
  - Adding the random mobs. (Easy)
  - Mobs that take up multiple spaces. (Extremely hard)
  	Currently the game engine does not have this included,
  	and it would require a major rewrite to add
  - Ranged attacks. (Easy)
  - Better pathfinding. (Unsure)
  - Local multiplayer. (Easy)
  - Difficulty for prebuit mobs. (Easy)
  - Difficulty for random mobs (Easy)
  - Mob swarm mode: Weak mobs, but there are a lot (Easy)
  - Randomized mob swarms. (Easy, but time consuming)
    Just imagine a swarm of randomly selected,
    prebuilt or randomized mobs, attacking you
  - Randomized mobs should have randomly generated,
  	yet realistic, names and a random icon (Very Easy)

	Feel free to suggest things on Github
